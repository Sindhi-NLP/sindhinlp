## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! To contribute, please follow these steps:

1. **Create an Issue**: Before starting any work, create an issue describing the problem or feature you'd like to work on. This helps avoid duplicate work and ensures your idea aligns with the project's goals.
2. **Get Assigned**: Wait for a project maintainer to assign the issue to you. This helps manage who is working on what and prevents overlap.
3. **Fork and Clone the Repository**: Once assigned, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sindhinlp.git
    cd sindhinlp
    ```

4. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your work.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-or-bugfix-description
    ```

5. **Make Your Changes**: Make your changes and commit them with clear and descriptive commit messages.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Description of the changes"
    ```

6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork.

    ```bash
    git push origin feature-or-bugfix-description
    ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main repository's `main` branch. Provide a clear description of your changes and reference the issue you created.

8. **Code Review**: Wait for a project maintainer to review your code. Be prepared to make any necessary changes based on feedback.
